Objective: Understand how inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another.

Task:

1. Create a base class Animal with the following attributes and methods:
    - String name
    - String species
    Constructor to initialize these attributes.
    Method makeSound() that prints a generic sound (e.g., "Some generic animal sound").

2. Create two subclasses, Dog and Cat, that inherit from Animal.
    - Override the makeSound() method in both subclasses to print "Woof" for Dog and "Meow" for Cat.

3. In your main method, create instances of Dog and Cat, set their names and species, and call their makeSound() methods.
