Exercise 1: Encapsulation
Objective: Understand and apply encapsulation by creating classes with private fields and public methods to access and modify those fields.

Task: Create a BankAccount class with the following requirements:

Fields: accountNumber (String), balance (double), accountHolder (String)
Constructor: Initialize accountNumber, accountHolder, and set balance to 0.0.
Methods:
    1. deposit(double amount): Add the amount to the balance if the amount is positive.
    2. withdraw(double amount): Subtract the amount from the balance if the amount is positive and less than or equal to the current balance.
    3. getBalance(): Return the current balance.
    4. getAccountHolder(): Return the name of the account holder.
    5. setAccountHolder(String name): Set the name of the account holder.
Goal: Implement the class in such a way that the balance and account holder's name cannot be directly accessed or modified outside the class.
