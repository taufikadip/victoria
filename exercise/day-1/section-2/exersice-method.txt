Exercise 1: Basic Method Creation
Objective: Understand how to create and use methods in a class.

Task: Create a class Calculator with the following requirements:

Methods:
- add(int a, int b): Returns the sum of two integers.
- subtract(int a, int b): Returns the difference between two integers.
- multiply(int a, int b): Returns the product of two integers.
- divide(int a, int b): Returns the quotient of two integers. If b is zero, print an error message and return 0.
Goal: Practice defining and using basic methods within a class, understanding method signatures, and handling simple conditional logic.
